Write a C program that performs the following operations:

Declare two integer variables num1 and num2 and initialize them with values 15 and 4 respectively.
Calculate and store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable called sum.
Calculate and store the difference between num1 and num2 in a variable called difference.
Calculate and store the product of num1 and num2 in a variable called product.
Calculate and store the quotient of num1 divided by num2 in a variable called quotient.
Print all results using printf() in the following format:
Sum: [value of sum]
Difference: [value of difference]
Product: [value of product]
Quotient: [value of quotient]
